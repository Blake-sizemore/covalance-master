Node Js- 
    runs javascript on the serverside
        no need for ruby/.net on serverside
        one langauge for both sides

    Created Full-stack developer

    USES V8 Engine for Chrome browser

    Diagram: Read from bottom up normal

        Chrome v8 ( base )
        Node binding ( build for each OS ) - C++/C
        Node Standard (   )
        Express - Modules ( )

    Express JS webserver

    How to use:
        Already installed
        $ node file.js ( just type node )

        $ node
            > var test = 

        Core Modules - basic use  ( more in low level that require more code )
            Common: 
                path - creates paths to files
                url - parse/manupulate URL
                http -  make Http request and listen on ports
                fs - read and write files
            
            Using Modules:
            var path = require('path');
                path.extname(file.txt); return txt
                path.dirname(images/sky.png  ) returns image

                Require - pull puts and files/content into a var
                
                _dirname - 
                .join

                Import - 
            
            http - creates a webserver

            Url - just like path but parse

            
            Security:
                Browsers do not interact with serverside actions they just read and write
                Node.js is ON the server and can cross into other servers.

        NPM 
            npm init
                create package.json in current package
                should exist in root folder
                this auto install when 
            
            npm install request --save ( pushes all donwloads/changes to package.json )
                no "--save" == external servers can use it

            -g
            does not add to package.json

        Readline - do not use on final product
            allows reading and use of console.log 
            
Working in Node:
    type node in terminal and you enter a node work space
    all javascript is test able in the terminal
