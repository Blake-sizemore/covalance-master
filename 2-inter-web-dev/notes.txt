FlexBox

    flex box and how to use
        display: flex
            default direction of flex is row
            defualt wrap is none
            !! use shorthand for speed
        flex-direction:
            flex-direction: row, row reverse, column, column reverse
        flex-wrap:
            no-wrap, wrap, and reverse wrap
        !! Shorthand
        flex-flow:
            row wrap, reverse-row no wrap
                this is both flex-wrap and flex-direction in any combo.

    Direction axes
        there are two directional axes.
            Main axis and Cross Axis
            row - main goes left to right while cross goes down
            column - main goes down while cross goes left to right

    justify-content: left and right adjustment
        Grouping
            flex-end
            flex-start
            center
        Spacing
            space-evenly
            space-around
            space-between

    align-items: top to bottom
        flex-start
        flex-end
        center
        stretch
        DO NOT THINK OF THE EDGES - Other langauges will change the main and cross directions
        Think english reading versus japanese

    Order:
        set on flex childern
        determines the order 
        The lower the number the closer it will be to start of the main axis
        Use: nth-of-type(x) { order: y}
            nth-of-type(1) { order: 3} = the third child will appear first
            nth-of-type(2) { order: 1} = the second child will appear second
            etc; 
    !! Shorthand
    flex: 1
        flex-grow - do not use
        flex-shrink - do not use
        flex-basis - do not use
        use to show size change and proportion
        use positive number to set porportion
        set class to childern
        the numbers create a proportional grid that adjust based on "flex units"

    Align self
        applies directly to the element it is on
        mimics the align features of the align items
        this also overwrites the high up functions

Bootstrap
    it is a framework
    twitter made bootstrap
    they made it browsersafe
    Important to read the documents
    this framework is a CSS/JS frame work

    Breakpoints:
        xs <576px 	
        sm ≥576px 
        md ≥768px 	
        lg ≥992px 	
        xl ≥1200px 	
        xxl ≥1400px
    Basic struture for row and column builds
        .container
            .row
                .col
        This build makes a equal distro
    Changing column widths directly
        use col-(2-11) as flexunits(fu) inside of row
        if one col is set the others adjust
        using breakpoints will also provide flexibility
    Variable width
        .col-lg-2
        .col-md-auto
        .col-lg-2
