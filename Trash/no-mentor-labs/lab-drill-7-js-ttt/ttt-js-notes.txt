document = refs to an entire document
    function = querySelectorAll = finds all tags in a document an  its linked documents ( html - css)
        ('') = will auto search most possible tags in a html doc. You can also add your own from th  css

New functions:
querySelectorAll = grabs all tags in a doc and makes them accessible to js.
addEventlistener = two argument (1st = a string for the type of event, 2nd = function to run when event happens)
NOTE: functions auto create a variable called click, when associated with addEventListner.
NOTE: the event is an object with ALOT of info. Use Target for now ( target: div.tag.class).

html property/class:
.textcontent = the text that is inside of html

How to assign content:
use '=' to assign .textContent to the clicked div. event.target.textContent='x'

Hint:
    Toggle a player/turn = use if else 
    cells[0].textcontent = whats in that cell upon click.
    use this to see if the current build can call you if you won a single box
    use '===' comparision 
    use && = and
    use || = or

Define parts of the game
We need to find our borad and establish its areas.

    We need to reset a board once the game has been won/draw

    We need to be able to leave a mark based off turn
        p1 leaves X's and p2 leaves O's
        Use click counter to track turns
        Out but text in h2 header to inform whats happening

    Check to see if a win has happend
        The soonest a win can happen is after 5 clicks
        Check for a win each time after the 5th click
        The last chance a win can happen is at click 9

    Push game results to players:
        Once a game is finished, win or draw we need to know ( use win check to find out)
        Results: X's win, O's win, and Draw
        
    Define wins by cells:
        0,1,2
        0,3,6
        0,4,8
        1,4,7
        2,5,8
        3,4,5
        6,7,8
        2,4,6
