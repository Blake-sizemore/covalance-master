Iems learned:
    JS
        document - turns a varaible into documents content
        querySelectorAll() - allows you to specifiy the information you want in the entire document
        querySelector() - allows you get ONE type of element in the document
        .addEventListner - creates an event varaible, ('name', function) string and function
            event - it is a varaible created that you can use
        .target - Where the event is taking place
        .textContent - the area in the targeted html
    CSS
        :hover - while mouse is over use define "element":hover
        :active - while clicking
        :visisted - once clicked and registered in history


Get get html row divs into javascript!

    Use a variable to get them into js.
        let cells = 
    
    define that we are pulling html doc into varaible
        let cells = document
    
    define how much of that doc we want to reference using a function
        let cells = document.querySelectorAll();
            
            More detail
            .querySelectorAll() = pull all of someting
            .querySelector() = pulls one of something

    tell function where to look
        let cells = document.querySelectorAll('row>div');
            outputs a nodeList [array of html]

            we can search directly form html and css, so classes and ids become useful
                row > div class is applied to the following:
                
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="top left"></div>
                        <div class="top middle"></div>
                        <div class="top right"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="middle left"></div>
                        <div class="middle"></div>
                        <div class="middle right"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="bottom left"></div>
                        <div class="bottom middle"></div>
                        <div class="bottom right"></div>
                    </div>

                console.log(cells) see above
    
Select HTML form my javascript via the nodeList Array.
    
    How to add an X: you need to click it.
        each cell (item in the cells array) needs to listen for an event click.
    add an event listener to the cells in the array
            we can only add an event listener to an indvidual 'cell
            cell = nodeList [0:<div=class='top left'], 1:<div....,etc ]
        
        for loop is best for going through arrays
            for (let i =0;i<cells.length;i++){
                    console.log(cells[i])
            } tester

             for (let i =0;i<cells.length;i++){
                    cells[i].addEventListener(argu1,argu2);
            } 
                argument 1 = a string "" of what type of event.
                argument 2 = a function of what we want to happen

            for (let i =0;i<cells.length;i++){
                    cells[i].addEventListener('click',clickedCell);
            } 
    we need to build the clicked cell function with no arguments

            function clickedCell () {
                console.log(working)
            }
    
    How does this work. ONCE you click a cell in that nodeList array 
    the loop will hear it and run the clickedCell function. 
        clickedCell returns a console.log of 'working' per click in the array


    functions being attached an event listener will make an 'event'

            function clickedCell () {
                        console.log(event)
                    }

    Free event = Mouse event object this event shows where shows the target
        click { target: div.top.left, 
            buttons: 0, clientX: 177, clientY: 125, layerX: 177, layerY: 169 }
        Currently event.target = what we clicked on "aka the html"

            function clickedCell () {
                        console.log(event.target)
                    }
    
Now we have access to the clickedcells html and its properties
    How do we add text? Use .textcContent
            
            function clickedCell () {
                            console.log(event.target.textContent)
                        }
            This outputs the selected <div class="bottom right">CONTENT</div> 
            and whats inbetween it

    So event.target.textContent is the area between the div's, big deal.
    ITS THE VARAIBLE FOR THAT SPOT IN THE HTML

            function clickedCell () {
                            event.target.textContent = 'x'
                        }

Hints and thinking for build a tic tac toe:
1st task: make players take turn ( x/o alternate) - Done

        tl,tm,tr
        ml,mm,mr
        br,bm,bl
        tl,ml,br
        tl,mm,bl
        tm,mm,bm
        tr,mr,bl
        tr,mm,br
